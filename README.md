## Introduction

The objective of this work is to apply concepts of probability and statistics to analyze a real dataset. Through descriptive and inferential analysis techniques, we aim to answer specific questions about the data and validate hypotheses.

## Methodology

The methodology applied in this work includes:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtaining the dataset to be analyzed.
2. **Descriptive Analysis**: Describing and visualizing the data through measures of central tendency, dispersion, and graphs.
3. **Inferential Analysis**: Applying statistical tests to draw conclusions about the population from the sample.
4. **Statistical Modeling**: Creating models to predict and explain variables of interest.
5. **Interpretation of Results**: Discussing and interpreting the statistical findings.

## Tools Used

The tools and libraries used in the project include:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy
- Statsmodels

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the practical application of probability and statistical techniques in the analysis of real data. Through descriptive, inferential analysis, and modeling, it was possible to obtain significant insights about the studied dataset.
